## Features
1: This dev board has a LED for power indicator.
2: This board has a 6-Axis Gyro + Accelerometer integrated in it. you can read the schematic to check it out.

## Caution:
> I have not routed the GPIO 0,1 and ADC 1 and 2 because of spacing problems. there was not enough space to route them because the accelerometer had covered most of that space.
